# OpenAI-chat-completion-API-parameters
Understanding these parameters will help fine-tune API's behaviour to generate better,more relevant responses for your application.

## Parameters
### 1. **Messages**
- **Purpose**: Defines the conversation context,including past interactions betweeen user and assistant.
- **Functionality**: Its a list where each message has a role(like user,assistant, or system) and content.The model generates a response based on these messages.
- **Example**:
       messages:[{role:'user',content:'What's the weather today?'}]
### 2. **Model**
- **Purpose**: specifies which version of language model to use(e.g.,GPT-3.5,GPT-4).
- **Function**: Different models have varying  level of complexity,performance and capabilities.The choice impacts response time,cost and quality.
- **Example**: Choosing gpt-4 may provide more accurate and creative answers compared to gpt-3.5 but it may also be slower or more expensive.
### 3. **Max Completion Tokens**
- **Purpose**: limits how long the model's response can be,in terms of tokens(words or parts of words).
- **Functionality**: It helps control the length of model's output.If you need shorter responses,you can set a lower value.
- **Example**: if max_tokens is set to 50,the model will stop generating after reaching 50 tokens.
### 4. **n**
- **Purpose**: Determines how many  seperate completions(responses) you want the model to generate for same input.
- **Functionality**:You can request multiple responses at once and choose the best one.
- **Example**:Setting n=3 will generate 3 different responses to the same prompt,allowing you to select the most appropriate one.
### 5. **Stream**
- **Purpose**:
