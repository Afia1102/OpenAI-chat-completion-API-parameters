# OpenAI-chat-completion-API-parameters
Understanding these parameters will help fine-tune API's behaviour to generate better,more relevant responses for your application.

## Parameters
### 1. **Messages**
- **Purpose**: Defines the conversation context,including past interactions betweeen user and assistant.
- **Functionality**: Its a list where each message has a role(like user,assistant, or system) and content.The model generates a response based on these messages.
- **Example**:
       messages:[{role:'user',content:'What's the weather today?'}]
### 2. **Model**
- **Purpose**: specifies which version of language model to use(e.g.,GPT-3.5,GPT-4).
- **Functionality**: Different models have varying  level of complexity,performance and capabilities.The choice impacts response time,cost and quality.
- **Example**: Choosing gpt-4 may provide more accurate and creative answers compared to gpt-3.5 but it may also be slower or more expensive.
### 3. **Max Completion Tokens**
- **Purpose**: limits how long the model's response can be,in terms of tokens(words or parts of words).
- **Functionality**: It helps control the length of model's output.If you need shorter responses,you can set a lower value.
- **Example**: if max_tokens is set to 50,the model will stop generating after reaching 50 tokens.
### 4. **n**
- **Purpose**: Determines how many  seperate completions(responses) you want the model to generate for same input.
- **Functionality**:You can request multiple responses at once and choose the best one.
- **Example**:Setting n=3 will generate 3 different responses to the same prompt,allowing you to select the most appropriate one.
### 5. **Stream**
- **Purpose**: Determines whether to receive model's response all at once or as it is being generated.
- **Functionality**:When set to true,the response is delivered incrementally,which is useful for real-time applications.
- **Example**:With stream=true,you can display text in chat interface as it is being typed,rather than waiting for the entire answer to complete.
### 6. **Temperature**
- **Purpose**: Controls the randomness and creativity of the model's responses.
- **Functionality**:A low value(e.g.,0.1) makes the response more deterministic and predictable,while a high value(e.g.,1.0) increases randomness and creativity.
- **Example**:if you want a more factual and focused answer,you would set the temperature to 0.2.For more imaginative or diverse response,set it to 0.8.
### 7. **Top_p**
- **Purpose**:influences  how many possible tokens the model considers when generating the response.
- **Functionality**: Limits the model to only considering the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability is greater than or equal to 'top_p'(nucleus sampling).This makes response more controlled.
- **Example**:if top_p is set to 0.9,the model will choose from the most probabale 90% of the next token possibilities,making the response more focused but still flexible.
### 8. **Tools**
- **Purpose**:Allows the model to use external tools,such as APIs or code execution.
- **Functionality**:This extends model's capabilities beyond simple text generation.For example,the model could use a code interpreter to run calculations or a browser tool to access the internet.
- **Example**:With the tools feature,the model can use a "code interpreter" to calculate math or run python code during a conversation.
## How these parameters interact?
The parameters work together to influence the behavior of OpenAI model:
-**Messages+Temperatue**: The messages define the context,and the temperature controls how creative or deterministic the response will be.
-**Model+Max_tokens**: The choice of model impacts the quality and depth of the response,while 'max_tokens' restricts the length of the output.
-**n+Stream**: If you request multiple responses with 'n',setting 'stream=true' will stream those responses incrementally,which will useful for interactive apps.
-**Top_p+temperature**: Both effect creativity,with 'top_p' focusing the token selection and 'temperature' adjusting the randomness of model's answers.
